# CisLunar Autonomous Navigation Control
This project presents a Reinforcement based implementation of an autonomous navigation control mechanism in cis lunar space. An agent is trained to navigate from an orbit around moon to reach a desired orbit around earth in an automated and adaptive manner.
The results obtained via conducting experiments by utilising the code from this repo has been published in the [International Astronautical Congress 2023](https://dl.iafastro.directory/event/IAC-2023/paper/79728/). An open-sourced copy of the same can be accessed at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375640838_Reinforcement_Learning_based_Optimization_of_the_Earth-Moon_Space_Supply_Network).
